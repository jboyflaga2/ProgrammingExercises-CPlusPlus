# This folder contains my [parts of my] solutions to the assignments, discussion sections, etc. of Stanford's CS106X course last Winter 2016

July 21, 2016 - I need to review data structures because I am giong to solve some programming problems in UVA Online Judge that need knowledge in data structures.

I was thinking that I'm going to retake/redo the assignments from the CS106B course last Spring 2011 (I tried to solve the assignments from that course last 2011).

Then I thought that I'm going to google for the latest CS106B course website and try to solve the latest set of assignments and exercises during the discussion sections. I was able to find the website but I needed to login before I can download the handouts.

I am not a Stanford student so I cannot login to be able to download the handouts.

:(

But I came accross the website of the CS106X course last Winter 2016. And the handouts are downloadable. So I decided to use that course website and all the resources available to be able to review data structures.

But the first handout, the handout on the Course Information (01-CS106X-Course-Information.pdf), says that uploading my code to GitHub is a violation to the Honor Code...

<blockquote>
	<p>The following four activities are among the many considered to be <strong>Honor Code violations</strong> in this course: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Looking at another student's code.</li>
		
		<li>Showing another student your code, or making your code public so
		that it’s searchable and easily discovered online or elsewhere.</li>
		
		<li>Discussing assignments in such detail that you duplicate a portion of
		someone else's code in your own program.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Uploading your code to a public repository (e.g. github.com or
		bitbucket.com)</strong> so that others can easily discover it via word of
		mouth or search engines. If you'd like to upload your code to a
		private repository, you can do so on bitbucket or some other
		hosting service that provides free-of-charge private hosting.</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

... so I'm not going to put the source code of my solutions to the assignment here. I will just write here the parts of the problems which I find difficult and how I was able to solve them. And I will also put here the finished executable of each assignment (with some kind of a signature to prove that I made them) and it's accompanying resources so that I have proof that I really finished the assignments.

But I will still put here my solutions to (some of?) the problems from Discussion Sections and lab. I believe it is not part of the Honor Code violation because the solutions are available on their website.
