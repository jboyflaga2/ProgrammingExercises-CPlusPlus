# My solutions to some programming problems of Stanford's CS106B course last Spring 2011

July 21, 2016, today (afternoon, about 2:00 PM Philippine time), I decided to do a retake the CS106B course from Stanford because I want to review Data Structures.

I first did this course last 2011 -- I started doing the first assignment on March and finished the last assignment on November (I was in college during that time).

The lecturer was Steve Cooper. I downloaded his lectures the first time I took the course but I already deleted the video files because I did not have much storage on our family computer during that time.

...But I still have the files for the assignments, the problems during what they call "Sections", the Lab problems, the slides, the Course Reader, the Blank Project and other things.

[Update: 11:55 PM]

The "Blank Project" does not match with Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition. 

I managed to make the linker errors and other errors for this simple code:
``` C++
#include "genlib.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	return 0;
}
```

But when I tried to compile the sample code for "Assignment 0 - Narcissism", it has lots of errors.

I already tried to look for possible solutions to the problem. Then I found this handout named "07P-Downloading-Visual-Studio.pdf". It says:

<blockquote>
We have not fully updated all of the CS106-specific libraries with the 2010 version of the software, so
resist any temptation you might feel toward downloading Visual Studio 2010. We already know that a part
of our graphics package doesn’t quite work under the jurisdiction of a VS 2010 project, so please stick with
the well-oiled and well-tested Visual Studio 2008 product. If you’d like to install the full version of Visual
Studio 2008 (not 2010), you’re welcome to do so, though the installation process is dramatically more
involved.
</blockquote>

So I think it has no solution. I have to install VS 2008 Express edition. But I don't have internet connection for now... so...

So what I am planning to do is not to redo those problems that involves graphics (or I will modify the problem to not include graphics).
